## ⚠️ Known Issues to Address

### 🔧 Testing Setup
- **Issue**: Lucide React icon imports causing Jest failures
- **Status**: Mock files created but need refinement
- **Next Steps**: 
  1. Update Jest config to handle ESM modules properly
  2. Create proper icon mocks for specific imports
  3. Add transformIgnorePatterns for node_modules

### 🔧 Test Coverage
- **Current Coverage**: 0% (due to import issues)
- **Target Coverage**: 70% threshold set
- **Components Tested**: Header, ServiceCard (tests written but failing)

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

### Staging Branch
- All refactored code is on `staging` branch
- Ready for merge to `main` after test fixes
- Contains complete production configuration

### Netlify Configuration
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `out` (static export)
- Headers and redirects configured
- Environment variables documented

### GitHub Actions
- Tests will run on push to main/staging
- Build verification included
- Security scanning configured
- Lighthouse performance audits

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Fix Test Issues** (Priority: High)
   ```bash
   # Fix Lucide React imports in Jest
   npm run test -- --verbose
   ```

2. **Test Deployment** (Priority: High)
   ```bash
   # Test production build
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

3. **Merge to Main** (Priority: Medium)
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge staging
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Monitor Performance** (Priority: Low)
   - Set up Lighthouse CI
   - Configure error tracking
   - Add performance monitoring
